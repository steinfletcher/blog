## Introduction

In this post we present one way of injecting dependencies in go - using higher order functions and closures.

Consider the following domain layer function that returns the user's profile.

```go
func GetUserProfile(id string) UserProfile {
    rows, err := db.Query("SELECT ...")
    ...
    return profileText
}
```
 
We will want to separate the code that works on the user data from the code that accesses the database. In this example we want to unit test the domain layer and any business logic whilst providing a mock for the database access function. Let's separate these concerns so each function has a single responsibility.

```go
// domain layer function containing any business logic or mapping code
func GetUserProfile(id string) User {
    ...
}

// database access layer function
func SelectUserByID(id string) UserProfile {
    ...
}
```

We can also reuse the `SelectUserByID` function in other domain functions. We'll need a way to inject `SelectUserByID` into `GetUserProfile` so we can unit test `GetUserProfile` and mock the database access layer in tests. One way to achieve this in `go` is to use a type definition for the function definition.

# Type definitions

Making `GetUserProfile` depend on an abstraction means we can inject a mock of the data access layer in the test. Two common ways to do this in `go` are to use an interface or a type definition. Type definitions are simple and don't require generation of a struct so let's employ one here. We will define type definitions for both functions

```go
type SelectUserByID func(id string) User

type GetUserProfile func(id string) UserProfile

func NewGetUserProfile(selectUser SelectUserByID) GetUserProfile {
	return func(id string) string {
		user := selectUser(id)
		return user.ProfileText
	}
}

func selectUser(id string) User {
	...
	return User{ProfileText: userRow.ProfileText}
}
```

`SelectUserByID` is a function that takes a user ID and returns a User. We do not define its implementation. `NewGetUserProfile` is a factory method that takes its dependencies as an argument - `selectUser` - then returns a function that can be invoked by the caller. This strategy uses a closure to give the inner function access to the dependency from the outer function. The closure captures the variables and constants of the context in which it is defined. This is referred to as `closing over` those variables and constants.

We can then invoke the domain function like so.

```go
// wire dependencies somewhere in the application
getUser := NewGetUserProfile(selectUser)

user := getUser("1234")
```

## An alternative view

If you are familiar with languages such as Java, this is analogous to creating a class, injecting the class dependencies into the constructor then accessing the dependency in a method. There is no functional difference between the approaches - you can think of a type definition of a function as an interface with a single abstract method (SAM). In Java we might use constructor injection to inject dependencies.

```java
interface DB {
    User SelectUser(String id)
}

public class UserService {
    private final DB db;
    
    public UserService(DB db) { // inject dependency into constructor
        this.DB = db;
    }

    public UserProfile getUserProfile(String id) { // access method
        User user = this.DB.SelectUser(id);
        ...
        return userProfile;
    }
}
```

where the `go` equivalent using a higher order functions would be

```go
type SelectUser func(id string) User

type GetUserProfile func(id string) UserProfile

func NewGetUserProfile(selectUser SelectUser) { // factory method to inject dependency
    return func(id string) UserProfile { // access method
        user := selectUser(id)
        ...
        return userProfile        
    } 
}
```

# Testing

We can now unit test our domain layer function providing a mock for the database access layer.

```go
func TestGetUserProfile(t *testing.T) {
	selectUserMock := func(id string) User {
		return User{name: "jan"}
	}
	getUser := NewGetUserProfile(selectUserMock)

	user := getUser("12345")

	assert.Equal(t, UserProfile{ID: "12345", Name: "jan"}, user)
}
```
